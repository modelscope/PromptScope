A fruit stand is selling apples for $2 each. Emmy has $200 while Gerry has $100. If they want to buy apples, how many apples can Emmy and Gerry buy altogether?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many apples Emmy and Gerry can buy altogether, we must first determine how many apples each person can individually purchase with their budget, and then add these amounts together. 

Step 1: Compute the number of apples Emmy can buy.
- Emmy has $200. Each apple costs $2. 
- Number of apples Emmy can buy = Total money / Price per apple = $200 / $2 = **100** apples.

Step 2: Compute the number of apples Gerry can buy.
- Gerry has $100. Each apple also costs $2.
- Number of apples Gerry can buy = Total money / Price per apple = $100 / $2 = **50** apples.

Step 3: Add the number of apples Emmy and Gerry can buy together.
- Total apples = Emmy's apples + Gerry's apples = **100** + **50** = **150** apples altogether.

Therefore, Emmy and Gerry can buy **150** apples altogether when they visit the fruit stand.",150,150,1.0

At the height of cranberry season, there are 60000 cranberries in a bog. 40% are harvested by humans and another 20000 are eaten by elk. How many cranberries are left?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","After humans harvested 40% of the 60,000 cranberries, they took \(60,000 \times 0.4 = 24,000\) cranberries. This leaves \(60,000 - 24,000 = 36,000\) cranberries. Then, the elk ate an additional 20,000 cranberries. 

So, after accounting for both human harvesting and elk consumption, **16,000** cranberries remain in the bog.",16000,16000,1.0
