James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To calculate how many pages James writes in a year, we need to multiply the number of pages per letter, the number of letters per friend, the number of friends, and then by the number of times he writes each week.

1. First, identify the number of pages per letter: James writes 3 pages per letter.
2. He writes to 2 different friends: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages per week for both friends combined.
3. He does this twice a week: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages per week.
4. There are 52 weeks in a year: \(12 \times 52 = 624\).

So, James writes **624** pages a year.",624,624,1.0
