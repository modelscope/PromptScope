Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much more money Betty needs for the wallet, let's break this down step by step.

First, calculate how much money Betty currently has. Since the wallet costs $100 and she has half of the money:

Betty has: $100 / 2 = $50

Next, determine how much money her grandparents gave her. They gave her twice as much as her parents, who gave her $15:

Grandparents' contribution: $15 * 2 = $30

Now, add the contributions from her parents and grandparents to the money Betty already has:

Total money after receiving additional funds: $50 (current money) + $15 (from parents) + $30 (from grandparents) = $95

Finally, subtract the total money Betty has after receiving additional funds from the cost of the wallet to find out how much more she needs:

Money needed: $100 (cost of wallet) - $95 (total money after additional funds) = **$5**

Therefore, Betty needs $5 more to buy the wallet.",5,5,1.0

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we need to subtract all her expenses from her initial budget. The total spent on other items is $30 (shirt) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt) = $143. From her budget of $200, she also has $16 left. So, the cost of the shoes is the difference between her budget, the amount left, and the total spent on other items: $200 - ($143 + $16) = $200 - $159 = **$41**.",41,41,1.0
