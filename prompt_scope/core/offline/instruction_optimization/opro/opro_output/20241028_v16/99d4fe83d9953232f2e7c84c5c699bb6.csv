Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","**1**

To find out how much more money Betty needs, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. The cost of the wallet: $100
2. Betty already has half of the money she needs: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) dollars
3. Her parents gave her: $15
4. Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents: \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) dollars

Now, let's add up what Betty has in total after receiving money from both her parents and grandparents:

\[ 50 + 15 + 30 = 95 \] dollars

Finally, subtract the amount Betty has from the total cost of the wallet to find out how much more she needs:

\[ 100 - 95 = 5 \]

Therefore, **5** dollars is how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet.",5,5,1.0
