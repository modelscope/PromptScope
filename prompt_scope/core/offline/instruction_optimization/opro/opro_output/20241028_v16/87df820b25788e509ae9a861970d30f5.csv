How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To determine how many pages James writes in a year given that he writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week, we need to break down the calculation step by step:

1. **Calculate weekly letters:** James writes to 2 different friends twice a week, so he writes $2 \times 2 = 4$ letters in total each week.
2. **Calculate pages per week:** Each letter consists of 3 pages, so for 4 letters, he writes $4 \times 3 = 12$ pages in total each week.
3. **Calculate annual pages:** There are approximately 52 weeks in a year, so if James writes 12 pages per week consistently throughout the year, his annual page count is $12 \times 52 = 624$ pages.

Therefore, James writes **624** pages a year.

This calculation assumes that the frequency and the number of pages per letter remain constant throughout the year, which appears to be the case based on the information provided.",624,624,1.0
