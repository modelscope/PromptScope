James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how many pages James writes in a week, then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year. Here is the step-by-step guide:

1. **Calculate pages written per week:** Since James writes a 3-page letter to 2 friends, that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages for 1 friend. Given he does this for 2 friends, it makes it \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages per week.

2. **Total pages written in a year:** There are approximately 52 weeks in a year, so James writes \(12 \times 52 = 624\) pages a year.

So, the answer is **624** pages.",624,624,1.0

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we need to subtract the sum of the costs of the other items and the remaining budget from her initial budget. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items whose prices she knows: 
$30 (shirt) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt) = $143

Now, subtract this total from her initial budget:
$200 (initial budget) - $143 (cost of known items) = $57

Finally, subtract the remaining budget from the amount left after buying the known items to find out how much was spent on the shoes:
$57 (after buying known items) - $16 (remaining budget) = $41

So, Alexis paid **$41** for the shoes.",41,41,1.0
