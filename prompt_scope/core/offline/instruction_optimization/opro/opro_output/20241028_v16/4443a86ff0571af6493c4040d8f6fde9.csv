Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","First, calculate how much money Betty currently has:
Betty has half of $100, so she has \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) dollars.

Her parents gave her $15, and her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which means they gave her \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) dollars.

Add up all the money she has now:
\[ 50 + 15 + 30 = 95 \] dollars.

To find out how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet, subtract the amount she currently has from the total cost of the wallet:
\[ 100 - 95 = 5 \] dollars.

Therefore, **5** dollars is how much more money Betty needs to buy her wallet.",5,5,1.0

James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many pages James writes in a year, we need to break it down step by step:

1. **Pages per Letter**: Each letter is 3 pages long.
2. **Letters per Friend**: He writes to 2 different friends.
3. **Total Letters Per Week**: Since each friend gets 2 letters a week and there are 2 friends, that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) letters.
4. **Pages Written Per Week**: Since each letter is 3 pages, for 4 letters, that's \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pages.
5. **Weeks in a Year**: There are 52 weeks in a year.

To find out the total pages written in a year:

\[12 \text{ pages/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 624 \text{ pages/year}\]

So, the final answer is **624** pages written in a year.",624,624,1.0

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we first need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract that from her initial budget.

Initial budget: $200

Total expenses for the shirt, pants, suit coat, socks, and belt:
\[30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = 143\]

Amount spent on shoes:
\[[\$200 - (total expenses)] - \$16\]

Let's calculate:

\[[\$200 - 143] - 16 = \$57 - 16 = \$41.\]

Thus, **Alexis paid $41** for the shoes.",41,41,1.0
