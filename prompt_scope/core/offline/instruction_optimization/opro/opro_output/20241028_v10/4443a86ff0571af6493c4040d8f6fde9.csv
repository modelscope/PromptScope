Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","**3

Explanation:

  1. The cost of the wallet is $100.
  2. Betty has half of the money she needs, so she has $100 / 2 = $50.
  3. Her parents gave her $15.
  4. Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so they gave her $15 * 2 = $30.
  5. In total, Betty now has $50 + $15 + $30 = $95.
  6. Therefore, Betty still needs $100 - $95 = $5 more to buy the wallet.

So, the answer is **5**.",5,5,1.0

James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To calculate how many pages James writes in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pages James writes per week.
2. Calculate the number of pages James writes in a year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages written per week

- James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends each week, which totals \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages per week.
- However, he repeats this process twice a week, so he writes \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages per week.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pages written in a year

Assuming a standard year of 52 weeks,

- James writes \(12 \times 52 = 624\) pages in a year.

So, the final answer is **624**.",624,624,1.0

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, let's first calculate the total amount she spent on the items we have receipts for.

She spent:
- $30 on a button-up shirt,
- $46 on suit pants,
- $38 on a suit coat,
- $11 on socks, and
- $18 on a belt.

Let's add these amounts together:

\[ \text{Total} = 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = 143 \]

So, she spent $143 on the items we know about.

Her budget was $200, and she has $16 left after her shopping. This means she spent:

\[ 200 - 16 = 184 \]

The amount she spent on shoes is the difference between what she spent in total ($184) and what she spent on the known items ($143):

\[ \text{Shoes cost} = 184 - 143 = 41 \]

Therefore, Alexis paid **$41** for the shoes.",41,41,1.0
