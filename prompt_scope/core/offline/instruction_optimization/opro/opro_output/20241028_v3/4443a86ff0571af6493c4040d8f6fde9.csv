A fruit stand is selling apples for $2 each. Emmy has $200 while Gerry has $100. If they want to buy apples, how many apples can Emmy and Gerry buy altogether?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","First, determine how many apples Emmy can buy with her $200.
$$\frac{\$200}{\$2/apple} = 100 \text{ apples}$$

Next, determine how many apples Gerry can buy with his $100.
$$\frac{\$100}{\$2/apple} = 50 \text{ apples}$$

Finally, add the number of apples Emmy can buy to the number of apples Gerry can buy to find the total number of apples they can buy together.
$$100 \text{ apples} + 50 \text{ apples} = 150 \text{ apples}$$

Therefore, **150** apples can Emmy and Gerry buy altogether.",150,150,1.0
