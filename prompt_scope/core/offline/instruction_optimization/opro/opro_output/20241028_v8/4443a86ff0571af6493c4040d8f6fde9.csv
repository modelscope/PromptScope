Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we first need to calculate the total amount she spent on the other items and then subtract that from her original budget. After that, we'll subtract the remaining amount she has left after all purchases.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate the total amount spent on clothing: 
   - Button-up shirt: $30
   - Suit pants: $46
   - Suit coat: $38
   - Socks: $11
   - Belt: $18

   Total spent on clothing = $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

2. Subtract the total spent on clothing from her original budget:
   - Original budget: $200
   - Total spent on clothing: $143
   - Money spent so far: $200 - $143 = $57

3. Now, subtract the remaining amount she has after all purchases from the money spent so far to find out how much she spent on shoes:
   - Remaining amount after all purchases: $16
   - Money spent so far (excluding shoes): $57
   - Amount spent on shoes = $57 - $16 = $41

Therefore, Alexis paid **$41** for the shoes.",41,41,1.0
