Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet, let's follow the procedure step-by-step:

1. **Determine how much money Betty currently has:**
   - The wallet costs $100.
   - Betty has half the money needed, so she has \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = \$50 \).

2. **Calculate how much money Betty's parents gave her:**
   - Her parents gave her $15.

3. **Calculate how much money Betty's grandparents gave her:**
   - Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so \( 2 \times 15 = \$30 \).

4. **Find the total amount of money Betty now has:**
   - Total = initial money + money from parents + money from grandparents = \( 50 + 15 + 30 = \$95 \).

5. **Subtract the total amount Betty has from the price of the wallet to find out how much more she needs:**
   - Wallet cost - total amount Betty has = \( 100 - 95 = \$5 \).

Therefore, **$5** is the amount of money Betty still needs to buy the wallet.",5,5,1.0

James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To solve this problem comprehensively, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pages James writes in one session: He writes a 3-page letter twice, so he writes \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages per session.
2. Determine the frequency of writing sessions per week: James writes to 2 different friends, and each friend gets a letter twice a week. So, he writes \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages per week for each set of friends.
3. Calculate the annual page count: There are approximately 52 weeks in a year, so over a year, he writes \(12 \times 52 = 624\) pages.

Thus, the total number of pages James writes a year is **624**.",624,624,1.0

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, let's first calculate the total amount she spent on the other items and subtract that from her initial budget of $200. Then, we will determine the cost of the shoes by subtracting the remaining money from the total spent.

\[ \text{Total spent} = \$30 (\text{shirt}) + \$46 (\text{pants}) + \$38 (\text{coat}) + \$11 (\text{socks}) + \$18 (\text{belt}) \]
\[ \text{Total spent} = \$30 + \$46 + \$38 + \$11 + \$18 = \$153 \]

Now, subtract this total from her budget of $200 to see where the remaining $16 came from (this confirms our method) and then calculate what was spent on shoes.

\[ \text{Budget} - \text{Total spent} - \text{Remaining} = \text{Shoes cost} \]
\[ \$200 - \$153 - \$16 = \text{Shoes cost} \]
\[ \$200 - \$169 = \$31 \]

So, Alexis paid **\$31** for the shoes.",31,41,0.0
