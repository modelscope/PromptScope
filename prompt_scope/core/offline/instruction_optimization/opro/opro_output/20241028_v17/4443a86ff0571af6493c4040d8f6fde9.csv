James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James writes 3-page letters.
2. He writes these to 2 different friends, so he writes a total of \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) pages per week for one set of friends.
3. Since he repeats this process twice a week, he writes \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) pages in total per week.
4. There are 52 weeks in a year, so over the course of a year, he writes \( 12 \times 52 = 624 \) pages.

Therefore, **624** pages is the number of pages James writes a year.",624,624,1.0

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To determine the amount Alexis paid for the shoes, we first need to calculate how much she spent in total before buying the shoes, and then subtract this amount along with the remaining budget from her initial $200 budget.

Given:

- Initial budget = $200  
- Cost of shirt = $30
- Cost of suit pants = $46
- Cost of suit coat = $38
- Cost of socks = $11 
- Cost of belt = $18
- Remaining budget after all other purchases = $16

First, sum up the costs of all items excluding the shoes:

\[ \text{Cost of shirt} + \text{Cost of suit pants} + \text{Cost of suit coat} + \text{Cost of socks} + \text{Cost of belt} \]

\[ 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = 143 \]

Next, subtract this total cost from her initial budget:

\[ \text{Initial budget} - (\text{Cost of shirt} + \text{Cost of suit pants} + \text{Cost of suit coat} + \text{Cost of socks} + \text{Cost of belt}) \]

\[ 200 - 143 = 57 \]

Finally, subtract the remaining budget she had after all purchases from the difference found above to find the cost of the shoes:

\[ (\text{Initial budget} - (\text{Cost of shirt} + \text{Cost of suit pants} + \text{Cost of suit coat} + \text{Cost of socks} + \text{Cost of belt})) - \text{Remaining budget} \]

\[ 57 - 16 = **41** \]

Therefore, Alexis paid **41** dollars for the shoes.",41,41,1.0
