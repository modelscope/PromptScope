1. Calculate the number of pages James writes to one friend: 3 pages * 2 times a week = **6** pages per week for one friend.
2. Since he writes to 2 different friends, multiply the weekly pages by 2: **6** pages/week/friend * 2 friends = **12** pages per week for both friends combined.
3. To find out how many pages he writes in a year, multiply the weekly pages by the number of weeks in a year (assuming no leap year): **12** pages/week * 52 weeks/year = **624** pages per year.

So, James writes **624** pages a year.",624,624,1
