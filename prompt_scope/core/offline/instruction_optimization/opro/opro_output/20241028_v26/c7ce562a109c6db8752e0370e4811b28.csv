2,"Following step-by-step instructions to solve this problem, let's calculate the total amount Alexis spent on items other than the shoes first:
Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet, let's break down the steps:

1. Betty initially has half of the $100 wallet cost, which means she has:
   \[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

2. Her parents give her an additional $15, bringing her total to:
   \[ 50 + 15 = 65 \]

3. Her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, which is:
   \[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]
   Adding this to her current total:
   \[ 65 + 30 = 95 \]

4. The wallet costs $100, so the amount of money Betty still needs is:
   \[ 100 - 95 = 5 \]

Therefore, **5** is the number indicating how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet.",5,5,1
4,"Following step-by-step instructions to solve this problem, let's calculate the total amount Alexis spent on items other than the shoes first:
James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many pages James writes in a year, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Pages per letter:** Each letter consists of 3 pages.
2. **Letters per person per week:** James writes 2 letters to 2 different friends, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) letters per week.
3. **Pages written per week:** Since each letter is 3 pages long, for 4 letters, James writes \(3 \times 4 = 12\) pages per week.
4. **Weeks in a year:** There are 52 weeks in a year.

Now, to find out how many pages James writes in a year, multiply the pages written per week by the number of weeks in a year:

\[12 \text{ pages/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 624 \text{ pages/year}.\]

So, the total number of pages James writes in a year is **624**.",624,624,1
8,"Following step-by-step instructions to solve this problem, let's calculate the total amount Alexis spent on items other than the shoes first:
Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we need to subtract the total amount she spent on the other items and what she has left from her budget.

First, add up the cost of the items we know she bought:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \$30 + \$46 + \$38 + \$11 + \$18 \]
\[ \text{Total spent} = \$143 \]

Next, subtract the total amount spent on these items from her original budget to find out how much was left before buying the shoes:
\[ \text{Budget} - \text{Total spent} = \$200 - \$143 \]
\[ \text{Amount remaining} = \$57 \]

Finally, subtract the amount she had left after buying the shoes from the amount remaining to find out how much she spent on the shoes:
\[ \text{Amount remaining} - \text{Left after shoes} = \$57 - \$16 \]
\[ \text{Cost of shoes} = \$41 \]

Therefore, Alexis paid **\$41** for the shoes.",41,41,1
