James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To calculate the total cost of the shoes Alexis bought, I need to know the price of the shoes first. Since that information is missing, I cannot proceed with the calculation. If you can provide the price of the shoes, I will be happy to help you calculate the cost.

To find out how many pages James writes a year:

1. First, determine the number of pages James writes per week: He writes 3 pages to each of 2 friends, so he writes \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages to both friends each week.
2. Since he does this twice a week, multiply by 2: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages per week.
3. Calculate the annual writing volume: There are 52 weeks in a year, so multiply by 52: \(12 \times 52 = 624\) pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages James writes in a year is **624**.",624,624,1
