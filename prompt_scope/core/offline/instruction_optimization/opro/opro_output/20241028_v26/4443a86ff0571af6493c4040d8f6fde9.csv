James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To calculate how many pages James writes in a year, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Determine the number of pages James writes to one friend each time he writes a letter: 
   - He writes a 3-page letter.

2. Calculate the total number of pages for one friend per week:
   - He writes to 2 different friends.
   - That is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pages per week for one friend.
   - Since he writes to two friends, it's \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages for both friends per week.

3. Calculate the total number of pages per year:
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, \(12 \times 52 = 624\) pages per year.

Therefore, the total number of pages James writes in a year is **624**.",624,624,1

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To calculate how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we can use the information provided to find her total expenditure and then subtract that from her original budget. 

First, let's add up the expenses for the items she has receipts for: 
- Shirt: $30
- Pants: $46
- Suit coat: $38
- Socks: $11
- Belt: $18

\[ \text{Total known expenses} = 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = 143 \]

Alexis had a budget of $200 and was left with $16 after her purchases. This means her total spending was:

\[ \text{Original budget} - \text{Remaining budget} = 200 - 16 = 184 \]

To find out how much she paid for the shoes (let's call this amount \(S\)), we subtract her total known expenses from her total spending:

\[ \text{Total spending} - \text{Total known expenses} = S \]
\[ 184 - 143 = S \]

\[ \text{Cost of shoes} = S = 41 \]

Therefore, Alexis paid **41** dollars for the shoes.",41,41,1
