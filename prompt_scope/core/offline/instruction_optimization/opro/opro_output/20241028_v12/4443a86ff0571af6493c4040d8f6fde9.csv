James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many pages James writes a year, we need to calculate the total number of pages written in a week first, and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends:** That's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages per week.
2. **He does this twice a week:** So, he writes \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages per week.
3. **There are approximately 52 weeks in a year:** Therefore, in a year, he writes \(12 \times 52 = 624\) pages.

So, the answer is **624**.",624,624,1.0
