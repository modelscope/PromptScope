A fruit stand is selling apples for $2 each. Emmy has $200 while Gerry has $100. If they want to buy apples, how many apples can Emmy and Gerry buy altogether?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many apples Emmy and Gerry can buy altogether, we need to divide their total money by the price of an apple.

First, calculate the total amount of money they have together:

Emmy has $200 and Gerry has $100. So, combined they have:
$$ 200 + 100 = 300 $$

Next, since each apple costs $2, we divide the total amount of money they have by the cost per apple:

$$ \frac{300}{2} = 150 $$

So, together, Emmy and Gerry can buy **150** apples.",150,150,1.0
