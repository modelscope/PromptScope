Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","**5**

To solve the problem step-by-step:
1. The cost of the wallet is $100.
2. Betty has half of $100, which equals $50.
3. Her parents give her $15.
4. Her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, which equals $15 * 2 = $30.
5. In total, Betty receives $50 (her savings) + $15 (from parents) + $30 (from grandparents) = $95.
6. To find out how much more money she needs, subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the wallet: $100 - $95 = $5.

Therefore, Betty needs **$5** more to buy the wallet.",5,5,1.0

James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To calculate how many pages James writes a year, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Pages written per week**: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends, meaning he writes \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages worth of letters each time. Since he does this twice a week, it adds up to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages per week.

2. **Pages written per year**: There are typically 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, if he writes 12 pages each week, in a year, he would write \(12 \times 52\) pages.

Now, calculating that: 

\[12 \times 52 = 624\]

So, James writes **624** pages a year.",624,624,1.0
