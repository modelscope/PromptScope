Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Betty currently has saved.
Betty has only half of the money she needs for the wallet, so:
Half of $100 = $50.

Step 2: Determine the contribution from her parents.
Her parents gave her $15.

Step 3: Calculate the contribution from her grandparents.
Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so:
Twice $15 = $30.

Step 4: Sum up all contributions.
Total contributions = Contribution from parents + Contribution from grandparents.
Total contributions = $15 + $30 = $45.

Step 5: Calculate how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet.
Amount still needed = Cost of the wallet - Total contributions.
Amount still needed = $100 - $45 = $55.

Therefore, Betty needs **$55** more to purchase the wallet.",55,5,0.0

James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many pages James writes in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pages written to friends each time.
2. Calculate the total number of times this happens per week.
3. Calculate the total number of pages written in a month.
4. Finally, calculate the total number of pages written in a year.

Let's start with step 1: 
He writes a 3-page letter to 2 friends, so each time, he writes \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages.

Next, step 2:
He does this twice a week, so he writes \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages per week.

Moving to step 3:
Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, he writes \(12 \times 4 = 48\) pages per month.

For step 4:
To find out how many pages he writes in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year), resulting in \(48 \times 12 = **576**\) pages written per year.",576,624,0.0
8,"Please think step-by-step and carefully follow the instructions below to determine the cost of the shoes Alexis bought for her job interview.
Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, let's first calculate the total amount she spent on the other items and then subtract that from her budget.

- Button-up shirt: $30
- Suit pants: $46
- Suit coat: $38
- Socks: $11
- Belt: $18

Total spent on these items = $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

Alexis had a budget of $200 and has $16 left after all purchases, so:
Total spent including shoes = $200 - $16 = $184

Now, subtract the total spent on other items from this total:
Amount spent on shoes = $184 - $143 = $41

Therefore, Alexis paid **$41** for the shoes.",41,41,1.0
