Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","**3**

Betty needs $100 for her new wallet. She currently has half of the money, which amounts to $50 ($100 / 2). Her parents gave her an additional $15, while her grandparents gave her twice what her parents gave, which was $30 ($15 * 2). In total, Betty now has $50 + $15 + $30 = $95. Therefore, she still needs $100 - $95 = $5 to cover the cost of the wallet. The answer is formatted as requested with the number **5**.",5,5,1.0

James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To calculate how many pages James writes in a year, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Pages per letter**: Each letter is 3 pages long.
2. **Letters per friend**: He writes to 2 different friends.
3. **Total pages per friend**: For each friend, he writes \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages.
4. **Frequency of writing**: Twice a week.
5. **Total pages per week**: For both friends, he writes \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages.
6. **Annual calculation**: There are 52 weeks in a year. Hence, the total pages written in a year is \(12 \times 52\).

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[12 \times 52 = 624\]

Therefore, **James writes 624 pages a year**.",624,624,1.0
