Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem.

James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many pages James writes in a year, follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pages James writes to one friend: \(3\) pages.
2. Since he writes to \(2\) friends, multiply the pages for one friend by \(2\): \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages per week for both friends combined.
3. Calculate how often he writes these letters in a year. There are \(52\) weeks in a year, and he writes letters twice a week: \(52 \times 2 = 104\) weeks of writing in a year.
4. Finally, multiply the pages he writes per week by the number of weeks in a year to get the total pages written in a year: \(6 \times 104 = 624\) pages.

Thus, **624** pages is the total number of pages James writes in a year.",624,624,1.0

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we need to subtract all her known expenses and remaining budget from her total budget.

First, letâ€™s calculate the total amount spent on clothes excluding shoes:

$$\text{Total spent} = \text{Button-up shirt} + \text{Suit pants} + \text{Suit coat} + \text{Socks} + \text{Belt}$$

Plugging in the given values:

$$\text{Total spent} = \$30 + \$46 + \$38 + \$11 + \$18$$

Now, compute the total:

$$\text{Total spent} = 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = \$143$$

Next, add the remaining budget to the total amount already spent:

$$\text{Total spent including remaining budget} = \text{Total spent} + \text{Remaining budget}$$

Substitute the numbers in:

$$\text{Total spent including remaining budget} = \$143 + \$16$$

Calculate this final total:

$$\text{Total spent including remaining budget} = \$159$$

Now, subtract this total from Alexis's original budget to find the cost of the shoes:

$$\text{Cost of shoes} = \text{Original budget} - \text{Total spent including remaining budget}$$

Insert the amounts:

$$\text{Cost of shoes} = \$200 - \$159$$

Calculate it:

$$\text{Cost of shoes} = \$41$$

Therefore, **Alexis paid \$41** for the shoes.",41,41,1.0
