Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet, let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount Betty already has**: She has half of the $100 wallet, which equals:
   \[
   \$100 \div 2 = \$50
   \]

2. **Amount given by Bettyâ€™s parents**: They gave her $15.

3. **Amount given by her grandparents**: They gave her twice the amount her parents did, which equals:
   \[
   2 \times \$15 = \$30
   \]

4. **Total amount Betty has now**: Sum all amounts.
   \[
   \$50 + \$15 + \$30 = \$95
   \]

5. **Calculate how much more Betty needs**: Subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the wallet.
   \[
   \$100 - \$95 = \$5
   \]
