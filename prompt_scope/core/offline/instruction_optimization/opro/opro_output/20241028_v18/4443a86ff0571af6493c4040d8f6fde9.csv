Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many pages James writes a year, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Pages per letter**: James writes a 3-page letter.
2. **Letters per friend**: He writes the letter to 2 different friends.
3. **Total pages for one round**: \(3 \text{ pages/letter} \times 2 \text{ friends} = 6 \text{ pages}\).
4. **Frequency per week**: He writes twice a week.
5. **Total pages per week**: \(6 \text{ pages} \times 2 = 12 \text{ pages}\).
6. **Number of weeks in a year**: A standard year has 52 weeks.
7. **Total pages per year**: \(12 \text{ pages/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 624 \text{ pages/year}\).

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, first, we need to calculate the total amount she spent before purchasing the shoes. Then, subtracting this from her initial budget will give us the cost of the shoes because she still had $16 left after all purchases.

1. Add up all known expenses:
   - Shirt: $30
   - Suit pants: $46
   - Suit coat: $38
   - Socks: $11
   - Belt: $18
   
   Total expenses except for shoes = $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18

2. Calculate the total:
   $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

3. Subtract this total from her initial budget to find out how much was spent on shoes:
   Initial budget: $200
   
   Since she had $16 left after all purchases, the amount spent on shoes = Initial budget - (Total expenses except for shoes + Remaining budget)
   
   Shoes cost = $200 - ($143 + $16)

4. Calculate the shoes cost:
   $200 - ($143 + $16) = $200 - $159
