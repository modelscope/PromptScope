Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","**3**

To find out how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet, let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine how much money Betty already has:** Since she has half of the total cost of $100, we calculate that:
   \[100 \div 2 = 50\]

   So, Betty already has $50.

2. **Calculate the amount her grandparents gave her:** Given that her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, and her parents gave her $15, we have:
   \[15 \times 2 = 30\]

   Thus, her grandparents gave her $30.

3. **Sum the contributions she received:** Add the amounts given by her parents and grandparents to what Betty already had:
   \[50 + 15 + 30 = 95\]

4. **Calculate the difference between the wallet's price and what she has:** To find out how much more she needs:
   \[100 - 95 = 5\]

Therefore, the answer is **5**, meaning Betty needs an additional $5 to buy the wallet.",5,5,1.0

James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many pages James writes in a year following your instructions:

1. James writes a 3-page letter to each of 2 different friends. This totals \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages per week (since he writes to 2 different friends).
2. However, you've asked for him to do that ""twice"" per week, so we should calculate \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages per week.
3. There are typically 52 weeks in a year, so to find out how many pages he writes in a year, we multiply his weekly total by the number of weeks in a year: \(12 \times 52 = 624\).

Therefore, **624** is the number of pages James writes a year.",624,624,1.0

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, let's first calculate the total amount she spent on the items we know about and then subtract that from her initial budget.

She spent:

- $30 on a shirt,
- $46 on suit pants,
- $38 on a suit coat,
- $11 on socks, and
- $18 on a belt.

Adding these amounts: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143 in total.

Alexis had a budget of $200 and has $16 left after buying all the items. This means the total amount spent on all items (both known and the shoes) was $200 - $16 = $184.

Subtracting what she spent on the known items ($143) from the total amount spent ($184), gives us the cost of the shoes:

$184 - $143 = **$41**.

So, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.",41,41,1.0
