Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","**3**

To find out how much more money Betty needs, follow these steps:

1. First, determine how much money Betty currently has. Since she has half of the $100 wallet price and has already received additional contributions, start with the total cost of the wallet.
```
$100 (total cost)
```

2. Calculate how much money Betty already has:
```
$100 / 2 = $50 (current amount)
```

3. Find out how much money her parents gave her:
```
$15 (from parents)
```

4. Calculate how much money her grandparents gave her, which is twice what her parents gave:
```
$15 * 2 = $30 (from grandparents)
```

5. Add the amounts given by her parents and grandparents to her current savings:
```
$50 (current amount) + $15 (from parents) + $30 (from grandparents) = $95 (total received)
```

6. Determine how much more Betty needs for the wallet by subtracting the total amount she has received from the total cost of the wallet:
```
$100 (total cost) - $95 (total received) = $5 (amount still needed)
```

Thus, Betty needs **$5** more to buy the wallet.",5,5,1.0

James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?The answer can be a sentence, however the final answer should be a number which should be able to correctly answer the problem. Please surround this number with **, e.g. **24**.","To find out how many pages James writes in a year, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it step by step.

1. **Pages per week**: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 friends. That means he writes \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pages once. Since he does this twice a week, he writes \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pages a week.

2. **Pages per year**: There are 52 weeks in a year, so if James writes 12 pages each week, in a year he writes \(12 \times 52 = 624\) pages.

So, **624** is the final answer that correctly answers the problem.",624,624,1.0
