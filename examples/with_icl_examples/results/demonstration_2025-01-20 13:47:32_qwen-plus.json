So, to find out how many clips she sold in May, you divide the April sales by 2.\n\n   \\[ \\text{May Sales} = \\frac{\\text{April Sales}}{2} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24 \\]\n\n3. **Total Sales (April + May)**: To find the total number of clips sold in both months, add the sales from April to the sales from May.\n\n   \\[ \\text{Total Sales} = \\text{April Sales} + \\text{May Sales} = 48 + 24 = 72 \\]\n\nSo, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72"

Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?",
        "output": "Let's denote the number of people on the first ship (100 years ago) as \\(x\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the previous one. So, in the second hundred years, the ship had \\(2x\\) people, and in the third hundred years, the ship had \\(4x\\) people (since \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\), doubling each time).\n\nThe total number of people eaten over the three hundred years is given as 847. We can set up an equation to represent this:\n\n\\[x + 2x + 4x = 847\\]\n\nCombining like terms gives us:\n\n\\[7x = 847\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{847}{7}\\]\n\n\\[x = 121\\]\n\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n#### 121"

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so you divide the number of minutes by 60.\n\n\\[ \\text{Time in hours} = \\frac{\\text{Time in minutes}}{60} = \\frac{50}{60} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the fraction of an hour**: \n\n\\[ \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n4. **Calculate earnings**: To find out how much she earned, multiply the fraction of the hour she worked by her hourly rate.\n\n\\[ \\text{Earnings} = \\text{Hourly rate} \\times \\text{Fraction of an hour worked} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Earnings} = \\$12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\]\n\n5. **Perform the multiplication**:\n\n\\[ \\text{Earnings} = \\$12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\$10 \\]\n\nSo, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.\n#### 10"
