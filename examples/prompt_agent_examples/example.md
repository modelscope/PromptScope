PromptAgent is a system designed to optimize prompts for language models. It uses a strategic planning approach to optimize prompts by iteratively selecting the best action from a set of actions based on the current state of the system. The search algorithm is chosen from MCTS and beamsearch.

Run `python examples/prompt_agent_examples/prompt_agent.py` to optimize a prompt. The configuration file `prompt_agent_*.yml` located in the same directory is employed.
